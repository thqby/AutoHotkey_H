# AutoHotkey #

AutoHotkey is a free, open source macro-creation and automation software utility that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It is driven by a custom scripting language that has special provision for defining keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys.

The [AutoHotkey Community forum](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/) is the primary source of support for AutoHotkey.

AutoHotkey v1 is not being maintained, but support is provided by community members.

* **Scripts not working**: For assistance getting code AutoHotkey scripts to work the way you want, start a topic in the [Ask for Help (v2)](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=82) or [Ask for Help (v1)](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=76) subforum, depending on your AutoHotkey version.
* **Bug reporting**: If in doubt about the nature of your issue, please post in [Ask for Help (v2)](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=82) for confirmation. Otherwise, bugs should be reported in the [Bug Reports](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=14) subforum.
* **False positives**: If you notice any AutoHotkey files (downloaded from official sources) are being flagged as suspicious or a virus, they are likely false positives. Please refer to our page on how to resolve or report these [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/safe.htm).
* **Other development topics**: For any other development related enquiries, please utilize the [AutoHotkey Development](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=37) subforum.


## How to Compile ##

AutoHotkey is developed with [Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs), which is a free download from Microsoft.

  - Get the source code.
  - Open AutoHotkeyx.sln in Visual Studio.
  - Select the appropriate Build and Platform.
  - Build.

The project is configured in a way that allows building with Visual Studio 2012 or later, but only the 2022 toolset is regularly tested. Some newer C++ language features are used and therefore a later version of the compiler might be required.


## Developing in VS Code ##

AutoHotkey v2 can also be built and debugged in VS Code.

Requirements:
  - [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools). VS Code might prompt you to install this if you open a .cpp file.
  - [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload, or similar (some older or newer versions and different products should work).



## Build Configurations ##

AutoHotkeyx.vcxproj contains several combinations of build configurations.  The main configurations are:

  - **Debug**: AutoHotkey.exe in debug mode.
  - **Release**: AutoHotkey.exe for general use.
  - **Self-contained**: AutoHotkeySC.bin, used for compiled scripts.

Secondary configurations are:

  - **(mbcs)**: ANSI (multi-byte character set). Configurations without this suffix are Unicode.
  - **.dll**: Builds an experimental dll for use hosting the interpreter, such as to enable the use of v1 libraries in a v2 script. See [README-LIB.md](README-LIB.md).


## Platforms ##

AutoHotkeyx.vcxproj includes the following Platforms:

  - **Win32**: for Windows 32-bit.
  - **x64**: for Windows x64.

AutoHotkey supports Windows XP with or without service packs and Windows 2000 via an asm patch (win2kcompat.asm).  Support may be removed if maintaining it becomes non-trivial.  Older versions are not supported.
